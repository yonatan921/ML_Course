Questions 2:
a) Because the data cannot be sepperte by liniar line we use kernel function to use polynomial curved function.
In this case of data it's look like x^3, or x^5 to be a good candidadte kernel degree.
b)The best lambda is 100 and the best kernel degree is 5 best error= 0.001.
On the enitre train set with lambda = 100 and k = 5 the trainig error is 0.
c1)poly > liniar -> The data is divided in high order polynom
c2)poly < liniar -> The data is divded in linier sperator
